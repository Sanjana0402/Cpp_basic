Make a class EvCar which has folowing attributes
    -carId which is a 6 digit number
    -carName which is a string
    -carPrice which is float
    -carBatteryType which is LI_ION, NI_CAD OR OTHER

    -a constructor to initialize all members by using received parameters
    -a constructor to initialize dummy/default values(default constructor)
    -getters and setters for each member


Our program should have the following features

    - A function that takes an array of pointer of type EvCar. Attaches to a heap initialized EvCar objects and returns the new pointer

    - A function that accepts an array of pointers to EvCar and returns the average carPrice from all objects

    - A function that accepts a carId and returns the carBatteryType for this matching EvCar
