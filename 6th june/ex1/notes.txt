Encapsulation
    Example : 
    class Car{
        private:
            int id ;
            std::string ModelName;
        public:
            Car(); //this function works with one or more data members of this class

            void UpdateModelName();

            // void CalculateInsuranceCost(); // NOT WORK
    }

---> hiding data members by binding them together inside the class


Abstraction ------ (focuses more on function part)



Encapsulation---------- (focuses more on data member part)



Inheritance ------ generalization and specialization 



Polymorphism
    - compile time Polymorphism
    - run time Polymorphism
    - [TO BE DISCUSSED LATER]

ICE : Internal Combustion Engine

objective : Application to maintain and process car related data

    -Data for ICE car and EvCar are different in format
        -Ice car has id, modelname, price, fuel type and fuel capacity
        - Evcar has id,modelname,price,battery type, rated range and battery capacity
        - Both types of cars must be registered with RTO but their registration cost is different.
         We need a function to get the calculated value

            - FOR ICE cars
                -Petrol has 13% of price as value
                -Diesel has 15% of price as value for registration

            - FOR EvCars
                -flat 3000 is the value
