    will be performed, where will memory come from, etc??
    2) What action will be performed when a unit of data 
    is to be deleted? [NOTHING FROM MY END!/SOMETING]
    
    3) What operators need to work with a car type data!!!
        - operations using operators [operator overloading]

        - if yes, what kind of copy [shallow/deep]
